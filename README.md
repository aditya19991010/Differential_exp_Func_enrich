# ðŸ“Š Differential_exp_Func_enrich

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project showcases a complete pipeline for analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs), generating informative plots, and performing functional enrichment analysis. The analysis was performed using RStudio (v4.3.2) on a dataset containing 48 biological samples.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features
	â€¢	Data Preparation:
	â€¢	Handling raw count data and target identifiers.
	â€¢	Created 1128 unique pairwise combinations for comparison.
	â€¢	Differential Expression Analysis:
	â€¢	Conducted DESeq2-based analysis.
	â€¢	Collapsed replicates and filtered low counts for robustness.
	â€¢	Stored results systematically using R lists.
	â€¢	Result Summarization:
	â€¢	Filtered DEGs (padj < 0.05, log2FC > 2) stored in an Excel workbook with organized sheets.
	â€¢	Visualization:
	â€¢	MA Plot: Mean normalized counts vs. log fold change.
	â€¢	Volcano Plot: log fold change vs. adjusted p-value.
	â€¢	Venn Diagram: Gene overlaps across multiple statistical thresholds.
	â€¢	Downstream Functional Analysis:
	â€¢	Gene Ontology (GO) Mapping using gprofiler2.
	â€¢	Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using clusterProfiler.
	â€¢	KEGG Pathway Analysis (limited due to species data unavailability).

## ðŸš§ Challenges Encountered
	â€¢	Non-model organism data (Hordeum vulgare) was missing from KEGG databases, requiring alternative universal enrichment strategies.
	â€¢	Observed slight discrepancies between GSEA and enricher() results, showcasing method sensitivity.

â¸»

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
	â€¢	Advanced R programming (looping, list handling, plotting).
	â€¢	Data cleaning, statistical analysis, and result organization.
	â€¢	Omics data interpretation and functional annotation.
	â€¢	Visualization and biological storytelling through plots.
